# Design

### Colour Scheme

I designed my colour scheme, based on the Project logo light blue. This also includes the blus from the map backgroung image of the game area.

- I have used `rgb(4, 65, 65)` for the dark text in the light background sections of the web pages.
- I have used `rgb(127, 255, 212)` for the light text in the dark background sections of the web pages.
- I have used `rgba(127, 255, 212, 0.5)` to give the images a more blue colour.
- I have used `rgb(220, 26, 6)` for the darker red text, in the red colour scheme.

### Typography

The entire Project uses the font "Caveat Brush", this is a fun font perfect to add some fun for the players. This font is from google fonts and is linked at the top of each html file.

### Imagery

As the website is for Countries and their Capitals, I have used an intersting image for the hero image, of a keyboard with each key a different flag. This image as all the images on the website, is downloaded with a full license from [piaxabay](https://pixabay.com/photos/country-countryside-dales-england-21460/). The game area image is a satalite image of Europe and downloaded from [pixabay](https://pixabay.com/illustrations/map-cartography-relief-map-1804891/). The favicon logo is also downloaded from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/vectors/flag-violation-report-icon-1095057/)
